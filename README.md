# Gitbook Publishing Template

Fork the repo, write the book, publish to Git Pages. This template repo takes the labor out of hosting and publishing docs for free using open source Gitbook Legacy, Github Actions, and Github Pages.

See the [publish.md](/publish.md) file for development and publishing instructions.

See [Gitbook documentation](https://michaelcollins.xyz/gitbook-legacy-documentation/en/) for advanced configuration options. The original docs are located [here](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook).
