# Rendering for photorealism

To achieve photo-realistic rendering, you should follow a physically-based rendering (PBR) workflow. This typically requires the use of a render engine that supports PBR surface shader materials such as the Principled BSDF material available in Blender 2.8+. Physically based materials use real-world measurements of a material's various properties. If you use these properties to configure your materials in 3D, you will theoretically get accurate rendering results. Here is a repository of materials property measurements you can use as a reference:

There are a great many considerations for achieving realism within renders. Will Gibbons has put together an extensive list of ways to improve the realism of renders on his website, [https://www.willgibbons.com/realistic-rendering/](https://www.willgibbons.com/realistic-rendering/ "https://www.willgibbons.com/realistic-rendering/").
